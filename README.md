## HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
You are a treasure diver! Your goal is to fetch all four chests at the bottom of the ocean by carrying them up to the surface! Touch the chest to pick it up, and bring it to the top of the screen to retrieve it. Because these chests are heavy, you can only carry one at a time. Be careful though, treasure diving is a dangerous job! There are sharks that will get faster as you get closer to the treasure. If the sharks touch you, you will lose the game. You can't wait forever for the sharks though, as you have a limited amount of Oxygen, tracked in the upper right hand corner! If you run out, you will also lose the game. Retrieve all four chests to win the game.

## ADDITIONAL GAMEPLAY MECHANICS
I believe the oxygen mechanic should qualify as extra credit for an above and beyond gameplay mechanic. You can play the game just fine without it and still have the danger of the sharks, but the oxygen mechanic ensures that you cannot be too patient in waiting for the sharks to pass. It also allows for strategic managment of the oxygen to see if you have enough time to go back to the surface to get more air.
